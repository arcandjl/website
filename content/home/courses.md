## FAQs

{{< spoiler text="Are there prerequisites?" >}}
It depends upon the course.  Courses designed for master's and PhD students in Economics are usually rather technical and require a solid background in basic mathematics and statistics.  On the other hand, I have never turned anyone away who wanted to sign up for one of my courses!

{{< spoiler text="How often do the courses run?" >}}
Most of these courses are 1 semester courses that run for 14 weeks, with each class meeting for 1h45 each week.  Check the Graduate Institute website to see when each course is given.

{{< spoiler text="Can I audit a course?" >}}
It depends. Some courses are structured around a fairly demanding corpus of problem sets: what you get out of the course is positively correlated with the amount of work you put in.
