## FAQs

{{< spoiler text="Are there prerequisites?" >}}
It depends upon the course.  Courses designed for master's and PhD students in Economics are usually rather technical and require a solid background in basic mathematics and statistics.  On the other hand, I have never turned anyone away who wanted to sign up for one of my courses!
