Born in Ebolowa (Cameroon) and a Canadian citizen, I am Professor in the Department of International Economics at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, which I joined in 2008. Since then, I have been the Chair of Development Studies, the founding director of the Center for Finance and Development and the Chair of the Department of International Economics.  I am a Founding Fellow of the European Union Development Network (EUDN), a Senior Fellow at the Fondation pour les études et recherches en développement international (FERDI), and have been a visiting professor at several universities in Africa, Brazil, the Caribbean and China. I was assistant and then Associate Professor at the Université de Montréal, and Professeur des universités at the Centre d'études et de recherches en développement International (CERDI). I consult, among others, for the World Bank, the FAO, UNCTAD, the UNDP, the WHO, the Gates Foundation and several national governments. More than 60 students have completed their PhD dissertations under my supervision.  I grew up in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
