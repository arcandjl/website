Born in Ebolowa and a Canadian citizen, I am Professor in the Department of International Economics at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, which I joined in 2008. From 2017 to 2020 I was department chair, from 2012 to 2016 I was the founding Director of the Center for Finance and Development and from 2009 to 2012 I was chair of Development Studies.  I am a Founding Fellow of the European Union Development Network (EUDN), a Senior Fellow at the Fondation pour les études et recherches en développement international (FERDI), and have been a visiting professor at several universities in Africa, Brazil, the Caribbean and China. I was assistant and then Associate Professor at the Université de Montréal, and Professeur des universités at the Centre d'études et de recherches en développement International (CERDI). I consult, among others, for the World Bank, the FAO, UNCTAD, the UNDP, the WHO, the Gates Foundation and several national governments.
