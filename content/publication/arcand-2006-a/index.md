abstract: In their celebrated contribution on credit rationing, Stiglitz and Weiss
  (1981) showed that the expected return to the borrower on a loan is increasing in
  the risk of the project it funds. In this paper, I show that their results do not
  necessarily carry over to the case where the agents’ preferences can be described
  by rank-dependent expected utility (RDEU). In particular, a pessimistic probability
  distortion function for borrowers can yield sufficient concavity in returns for
  the latter to be decreasing in risk, thus eliminating adverse selection. Whether
  credit rationing can obtain or not is then shown to depend upon the interaction
  between borrower pessimism and lender optimism.
