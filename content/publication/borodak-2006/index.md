abstract: This paper considers whether it is differences in technical efficiency or
  differences in factor endowments that explain productivity differentials in Moldovan
  agriculture. We compute non-parametric measures of technical efficiency for a sample
  of Moldovan small-holders using the four-step Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach
  suggested by Fried, Schmidt and Yaisawang (1999). We also consider a model of class
  structure inspired by the work of Eswaran and Kotwal (1986), and estimate a bivariate
  probit model that explains a household's labor market participation decisions (and
  hence class membership) in terms of its factor endowments. These constructs are
  then used in an effort to understand the determinants of output per hectare in Moldovan
  agriculture. We find that differences in technical efficiency explain very little
  of the great heterogeneity in productivity observed in our sample, while class membership
  is slightly more successful. Our empirical model of class structure suggests that
  self sufficient households will disappear and be replaced by a class of small capitalist
  farmers as land and credit markets develop.
