abstract: 'The purposes of this paper are twofold. First, we examine, using a unique
dataset collected in the Tunisian village of El Oulja, what might be termed "all
  or nothing" separability (Benjamin, 1992) by testing, while controling for
  plot characteristics (Udry, 1996), the proposition that farm input use is independent
  of household characteristics. Second, we test for separability in the context of
  a model of class structure based on the seminal work of Eswaran and Kotwal (1986).
  In order to do so, we construct a model of class structure which offers an appealing
  representation of the typology of household types in the village when they are classified
  in terms of (i) their hiring in of wage labor, and (ii) their hiring out of family
  labor. We use a two-stage estimation technique in which we first estimate the probability
  of class membership as a function of household characteristics using discrete choice
  methods. In the second stage we estimate labor intensity per hectare using a Lee-Heckman
  procedure in which the inverse-Mill ratio from the first stage is included as an
  additional explanatory variable. As with the case of the test for &quot;all or nothing&quot;
  separability, the test for selective separability involves exclusion restrictions
  on household characteristics, although these are now conditional on class membership.
  Our empirical results strongly support the selective separability hypothesis as
  well as our theoretical model: most of the &quot;action&quot; in terms of non-separability
  stems, as one would expect from the model, from the class of &quot;self-cultivators&quot;
  who neither hire in wage labor nor hire out family labor. Our paper extends the
  work of DeJanvry, Sadoulet and Benjamin (1996) on Mexican ejidatarios to plot- as
  opposed to household-level estimation. Moreover, our paper provides an elaboration
  on and an empirical bridge to theoretical models, such as Roemer (1982), Eswaran
  and Kotwal (1986), and Carter and Zimmerman (1995) which examine how credit constraints and imperfections on factor markets shape the class structure of the agrarian economy. The implications and scope for government intervention in the context of market imperfections are also examined.'
