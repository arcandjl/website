abstract: This paper aims to provide the first evidence concerning the relationship
  between time and risk preferences and illegal migration in an African context. Based
  upon our theoretical model and using a unique data set on potential migrants collected
  in urban Senegal, we evaluate a measure of time and risk preferences through the
  individual's intertemporal discount rate and coefficient of absolute risk aversion.
  Remarkably, our results show that these individual preferences matter in the willingness
  to migrate illegally and to pay a smuggler.
